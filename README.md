# voting-machine-nexys.a7
Our project is to build a voting machine using HDL (Hardware Description Language) and hardware components.
The voting machine is going to have two modes. The first one is the Voting mode in which the votes will be cast for the different candidates
and the second one is the Tallying mode in which the votes accumulated by every candidate can be displayed. 
This program is primarily written using EDA playground which is a web-based ide along with some RTL images from Xilinx, Vivado.
